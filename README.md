# QA_pre-learning_2020
A few tasks from my pre-learning I needed to complete in preparation for my QA DevOps Bootcamp

- Challenge 1: Return a tuple with three elements
- Challenge 2: Append item to the_list
- Challenge 3: Return a dictionary with two key-value pairs:
    1. The key 'list_length' stores the length of the_list as its value.
    2. The key 'unique_items' stores the number of unique items in the_list as its value.

Here is my certificate of completion :smile:
